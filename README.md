# Github Stars in Ruby

## Reason

Github only shows 30 repositories per page on a user's profile. Personally, I have 350+ starred repositories, so having to click "Next" for every page is ridiculous.

## Time Saved

This really depends on how many stars a user has on their page. For my account [@syedabutalib](https://github.com/SyedAbutalib), it takes 53 seconds to get to the last page of my starred repositories. Using this app, it only took 11 seconds, which is only 20% of the original time.

## Installation

`gem install bundler`

`bundle install`

`ruby app.rb`

go to `http://localhost:4567/`
